# music-controller
a django app with react frontend allowing users to create rooms where people can gather and listen to music. inspired from https://github.com/techwithtim/Music-Controller-Web-App-Tutorial and improved upon by updating code to be compatible with latest framework versions


This project is now sunset as the project i am following is far too out of date and does not conform to modern django best practices
